## Goals

- Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

## Plan

- Relax and meditate
- Do the challenges of the week and attend to the workshops
- Read the documentation provided
- Debug programs
- Use the solving problems technique
- Pairing sessions: work with my pair to solve the problems
- Get feedback from my pair.

## Challenges

- Oyster
- Takeway

  <p><b>Things that went well:</b></p>
 <p>
<b><i>Communication</i></b> - you always explained your thought process when you wanted to try something. If you didnâ€™t understand something you always raised it.</p>
 <p>
<b><i>Listening</i></b> - you always listened if I had something to say and then tried to work with I said</p>
 <p>
<p><b>Things to improve:</b></p>
 <p>Genuinely struggling to come up with something not good about your pairing style, I thought it was very collaborative which was great. Perhaps something will come to mind after my session this afternoon, in which case I'll send it across :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
